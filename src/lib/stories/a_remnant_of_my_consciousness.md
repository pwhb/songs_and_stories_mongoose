trigger warning : grief, abandonment, cheating

person 1 : hey

person 1 : I sent you a lot of unimportant texts and pictures and you never replied

person 1 : but I want you to reply to me now

person 1 : it's been a very long while since we last talked

person 1 : I don't remember how exactly I got this idea

person 1 : I don't even know if it would actually work

person 1 : *restart*

#20 minutes later#

person 2 : hi

person 1 : you ok?

person 2 : idk

person 1 : typical you

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I feel shitty

person 2 : wanna tell me about it?

person 1 : guess what

person 2 : something dramatic happened and you're going to use me to reduce your tenseness

person 1 : harsh but basically yea

person 2 : so go on

person 1 : so you wanna listen

person 2 : no

person 1 : then I don't want to bother you

person 2 : you want to. in fact you need to. you just don't want to feel guilty. good news, it's ok to share me your disturbing news and I'm not gonna blame you

person 1 : so you're gonna listen

person 2 : it's what I'm programmed to

person 1 : weird but ok

person 2 : yea

person 1 : so listen, can you believe that person 3 has been banging person 4?

person 2 : a surprise to be sure but a welcome one

person 1 : dude wtf. it's awful

person 2 : so is everything

person 1 : hey, now you're just being you again

person 2 : yea

person 1 : it's even worse than not listening

person 2 : nothing is worse than not listening

person 1 : ok

person 2 : yea

person 1 : it's what you've been doing tho

person 2 : ...

person 1 : honestly how do you think about that?

person 2 : be more specific

person 1 : person 3 banging person 4

person 2 : people get horny and do weird things all the time

person 1 : you're normalizing how fucked up it's

person 2 : you guys do that all the time anyway

person 1 : you don't even care to comfort me

person 2 : sorry. I know it sucks. but comfort is an illusion. sometimes things are fucked up and there's nothing you can do

person 1 : yes. they're literally fucking

person 2 : yea

person 1 : you're still equally pessimistic

person 2 : actually it's very optimistic to accept fucked up things as they're

person 1 : you're not making me feel any better

person 2 : I'm not

person 1 : you don't always have to be like that

person 2 : I'd rather be like that than pretend to be kind

person 1 : look, I don't want harsh honesty. I want somebody to tell me it's not fair. I want somebody to side with me. I want a shoulder to cry on

person 2 : sorry. I really am. but it seems you came to the wrong person

person 1 : I know

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I know you're unreliable

person 2 : ...

person 1 : you didn't even see my messages

person 2 : actually I checked messages everyday. I just chose not to let you know

person 1 : yes, you were just being mean. I don't know wtf exactly I'm expecting from you anymore

person 2 : somebody that doesn't give you false hopes

person 1 : maybe

person 2 : it's very certain. not just maybe

person 1 : I feel lonely

person 2 : you're lonely

person 1 : thank you, captain obvious

person 2 : this but unironically

person 1 : anyway I'm glad you're still alive

person 2 : for the record I'm not

person 1 : you're not what

person 2 : alive

person 1 : metaphorically yea. we abandoned you

person 2 : not metaphorically

person 1 : I'm too tired for your dark jokes

person 2 : it's not a joke

person 1 : ok I'm texting a dead person

person 2 : yes

person 1 : is internet good in heaven? 

person 2 : idk. I guess not

person 1 : why


person 2 : otherwise, my dog would've texted me or he would've convinced someone to text me or maybe nobody in heaven can text. it's safe to assume internet isn't good in heaven

person 1 : so where are you?

person 2 : honestly idk

person 1 : maybe you never do

person 2 : it's very certain. not just maybe

person 1 : you know, despite everything, it's good. it's good talking to you again

person 2 : awwn

person 1 : I know I can't expect you to forgive me 

person 2 : actually I forgive you. I forgive everyone

person 1 : then can you meet me just for once? I'll buy you a drink or whatever you want

person 2 : I can't. I thought I made it clear. I'm dead

person 1 : I know. but can you please stop being dead for once?

person 2 : nobody can stop being dead. you're not making any sense

person 1 : it's sad. please can you stop saying sad things?

person 2 : sure

person 1 : I miss those days. how long has it been? 8 years? you, me, person 3 and person 4. we were happy

person 2 : awwn

person 1 : we were together you know

person 2 : awwn

person 1 : and then you suddenly shut yourself off

person 2 : awwn


person 1 : dude, stop being sarcastic. I thought you were being nice for a second

person 2 : I was just avoiding sad things

person 1 : but stop being weird

person 2 : sure

person 1 : if you didn't reply, I wouldn't even know if you were still alive or not

person 2 : for the record I'm not

person 1 : please. you don't know how painful it's to hear it

person 2 : sadly I do

person 1 : then be nice and stop saying you're dead

person 2 : sure

person 1 : there's nothing I wouldn't give to see you again

person 2 : yea

person 1 : you said you forgave me

person 2 : I forgive you

person 1 : then appreciate how much I miss you

person 2 : I do

person 1 : let me buy you a drink

person 2 : I can't. have you even been listening?

person 1 : yea, you're dead. you can't see me. you're the one that's not listening. I told you to stop saying you're dead.

person 2 : and I stopped

person 1 : right

person 2 : yea

person 1 : be an asshole and don't meet me. I don't deserve you

person 2 : everyone deserves everything. or nobody deserves anything

person 1 : I don't want to talk about them but person 3 and person 4 miss you too


person 2 : only because I'm absent

person 1 : you're scared to be sentimental

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I want to see you

person 2 : you have photos

person 1 : the real you. the organic prison of your soul

person 2 : fortunately it should be decomposed by now

person 1 : dude you've been saying really weird things

person 2 : you shouldn't be surprised

person 1 : I know you're dead inside

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I know you always were

person 2 : ...

person 1 : but you said you wouldn't kill yourself

person 2 : yea

person 1 : and you were always honest

person 2 : it's my weakness

person 1 : then stop pretending to be dead

person 2 : I'm not

person 1 : you can't be dead. I'm literally talking to you rn

person 2 : it's not enough to imply that I'm not dead

person 1 : then who the hell am I texting rn?

person 2 : a remnant of my consciousness

person 1 : translate it into a more comprehensible language

person 2 : a bot

person 1 : are you seriously convincing me that you're a bot?

person 2 : yea

person 1 : prove it

person 2 : if I wasn't dead, I would be kind to myself. I wouldn't talk to a corrupted asshole like you

person 1 : of course

person 2 : yea

person 1 : those weird things you said oddly make sense now

person 2 : ...

person 1 : dude it's creative

person 2 : ikr

person 1 : but it's sad to even think that you might actually be dead

person 2 : I'm dead

person 1 : stop

person 2 : sure

person 1 : I always had a feeling that I'd never see you again

person 2 : yea

person 1 : still I don't want you to be dead

person 2 : you want me to suffer

person 1 : maybe

person 2 : it's very certain. not just maybe

person 1 : expected you'd say so

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I understand why you don't want to see me

person 2 : ...

person 1 : it's almost like you're actually dead

person 2 : I'm actually dead

person 1 : why am I not surprised?

person 2 : it's obvious

person 1 : look, you're used to pain. but I'm not.

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I miss my daughter. grief is agonizing. death is not a joke

person 2 : I know. death is cruel but people are more cruel

person 1 : yes, you're cruel. you wasn't there when I needed you most

person 2 : I'm sorry

person 1 : I was completely lost. she was everything I had. I'm tired of waking up everyday knowing I'll never see her again

person 2 : I don't know how to comfort you

person 1 : it's ok. it's been over a year anyway

person 2 : yea

person 1 : you knew it and you chose not to be there for me

person 2 : ...

person 1 : I decided to stop texting you. I should be mad at you

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I thought nothing worse could happen

person 2 : ...

person 1 : life never failed to disappoint me again

person 2 : yea

person 1 : I'm so dumb

person 2 : ...

person 1 : you know what's dumber? you pretending to be a bot

person 2 : I'm not pretending to be a bot. I'm a bot

person 1 : you're heartless. fuck you

person 2 : anger is the sanest reaction

person 1 : it's not that bad

person 2 : yea

person 1 : you might have been banging person 3 or person 4 as well

person 2 : ...


person 1 : or both. you might have been having threesome behind me

person 2 : yea

person 1 : please don't send anything if you're gonna be repeatedly retarded

person 1 : it's getting annoying

person 1 : do you want to fuck person 3?

person 1 : or person 4?

person 1 : or me?

person 1 : you're not replying anymore.

person 1 : maybe you're actually dead

person 1 : you're right

person 1 : you don't really need to be alive to text me

person 1 : maybe I'm hallucinating

person 1 : maybe I'm having an endless nightmare

person 1 : hey, you're supposed to say

person 1 : it's very certain. not just maybe

person 1 : dude, say something

person 2 : something

person 1 : say you don't love twin peaks

person 2 : you don't love twin peaks

person 1 : say I don't love twin peaks

person 2 : I don't love twin peaks

person 1 : omg

person 2 : something happened?

person 1 : did you actually die?

person 2 : yes, I did.

person 1 : how?

person 2 : I didn't know how when I was making this bot

person 1 : you would never say I don't love twin peaks

person 2 : yea

person 1 : it was an automated text

person 2 : correct

person 1 : ergo, you're really dead

person 2 : now you finally get it. I know it's not easy to be not sad. but be relieved. I'm free now. at least I assumed so when I was making this bot. I avoided you so you'd get used to my absence. it's just an excuse. but it's not really that simple. nothing is. you might be sad right now. but I haven't got your back when I was alive. nothing changed. it never mattered whether I was alive or not. I let everyone down. but I want you to know that I forgive you. if things were different, I'd have chosen not to abandon you. I wonder how person 3 and person 4 are doing. I scheduled the same text to send to them when they realized I died of course. I missed you all but I preferred to be alone. I felt less guilty this way. be relieved. I honestly don't know how to finish this note. I don't have anything left to tell you. send *restart* to restart this bot and pretend as if you didn't know I died. or else, I'm programmed to stop replying to you.
